     * to re-register the application and retrieve new credentials.
     * <p>This should be considered an advanced feature. If you make this available to end users, it
     * should not be made too easily accessible and the UI control should be marked and possibly labeled
     * to accentuate that it will wipe settings both in the cloud and locally on the device. We
